# Mahalanobis-distance-outlier-detection
 
In these scatter plot values of vowel pronuncations, outliers were found due to errors from the automated formant extraction tool. The Rmd file shows how each vowel environment retained 95% of vowels in the ellipsis and excluded the remaining 5% of outliers. After the data were re-complied, the visuals below show how the outlier formants were removed and the difference is visible, even at the "bird's eye view" of over 165,000 tokens.
